This project is used to enhance my learning of HTML/CSS by creating a simple website layout, google.com .

SKills learned from completing this task:
- How to format a webpage that has a navigation bar at the top, the center body and a footer at the bottom.
- How to keep a webpage functioning even when the browser tab is moved around into weird dimensions.
- How to add and edit forms inside of a web page.
- How to combine HTML and CSS to create a webpage that is both functional and looks good.
